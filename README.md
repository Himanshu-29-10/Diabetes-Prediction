# Diabetes Prediction Using Pima Indians Dataset

## Aim
The aim of this project is to build a predictive model using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The model will classify whether a patient is diabetic based on features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

## Observation
This project demonstrates how to preprocess and analyze a medical dataset. It evaluates the performance of different machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or other classifiers, to predict diabetes. The observation focuses on identifying the most important features contributing to the prediction and evaluating the model's accuracy.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

## Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset includes the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Plasma glucose concentration
- Diastolic blood pressure
- Triceps skinfold thickness
- 2-Hour serum insulin
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
- Outcome (whether the patient is diabetic or not)

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the dataset and perform basic operations like handling missing values and normalizing features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the distribution of features and their correlation with the target variable.
3. **Model Training:** Train different classification models to predict diabetes.


## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. **Run this command on your local machine:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells sequentially.

## Conclusion
This project provides a step-by-step guide on building a machine learning model for diabetes prediction, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation in achieving accurate predictions.
